# TI-83 programs

Some TI-83 programs I wrote back when I was finishing Year 12 of
high school in 1998. This was the first year that Western Australian
students were allowed to take graphing calculators into their
tertiary entrance exams.

Downloaded from ticalc.org: very impressive that the programs existed
on that site for twenty-three years.
