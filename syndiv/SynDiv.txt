SynDiv 1.0 by Grahame Bowland - release 06/05/98
-----------------------------

Description
-----------

Given an equation of degree n in the form:
  ax^n + bx^(n-1) + cx^(n-2) .... + px^(0)
SynDiv will attempt find a factor in the form (x + z).

-------------
How to use it
-------------

Enter the degree of the equation (the highest power of x) and enter the 
number of each power present. ie For x^5 + x^3 + 3x^2 + x I would input:
  5 <enter> - the degree of the equation
  1 <enter> - no. x^5 terms
  0 <enter> - no. x^4 terms
  1 <enter> - no. x^3 terms
  3 <enter> - no. x^2 terms
  1 <enter> - no. x^1 terms
  0 <enter> - no. x^0 terms

Then choose whether to allow the program to search for a root or to enter 
the root manually (a root is a number which, when substituted into the equation causes 
the equation to equal zero.)

______________
1: Auto Search

If you select Auto Search then you will be prompted for "Delta R". This is the increment 
by which the program increases its guess each repeat. Typically, set this to 0.1. You are then 
prompted for "Start" - the number that the search looks to the left and right of. Typically 
set this to 0.

The program then displays that it is searching and the numbers currently being checked. When a 
root is found the program displays its results.

_____________
2: Enter Root

Upon selecting this option you are prompted for the "Root".  You should only use this option if
you know the root or wish to find whether a number is the root. If the number you enter is not 
the root you are prompted:
	ERROR
        FINAL d/n= 0
        RESTART!
Ignore any results that are given after this message.

________________________
Interpreting the Results

The results are then displayed - if you received an error message then disregard these results.
To show how to read the results, I will give an example.

FACTOR:X+1
X^6:
X^5:
X^4:
X^3:
X^2:1
X^1:2
X^0:0

This can be reconstructed to:
Factor * (no. x^6 + no. x^5 + no. x^4 + no. x^3 + no. x^2 + no. x^1 + no. x^0)
= (x+1)(x^2 + 2x)
