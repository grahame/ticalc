Description
-----------

FTrans is a TI-83 program that calculates the effects of transformations 
upon functions, and upon points on those functions.

-------------
How to use it
-------------

_____________
Options 1 & 2

Option 1 calculates the effects of the transformation f(x) -> af(bx + c) + d.
Option 1 calculates the effects of the transformation af(bx + c) + d -> f(x).

Selecting either of these options displays the transformation you have selected. 
Enter a, b, c, and d as prompted. For example, to examine the effects of a 
transformation for y = f(x) to y = 2f(2x) I would enter (after selecting 1 from the 
main menu):
  2 <enter>
  2 <enter>
  0 <enter>
  0 <enter>

The translations are then displayed one by one, in the order they occur.

_____________
Options 3 & 4

Option 3 calculates the x and y co-ordinates of a point on y = f(x) that has 
         undergone a transformation of f(x) -> af(bx + c) + d.
Option 4 calculates the x and y co-ordinates of a point on y = af(bx + c) + d 
         that has undergone a tranformation of af(bx + c) + d -> f(x).

Selecting either of these options displays the transformation you have selected. 
Enter a, b, c, and d as prompted (see example above.)  Then enter the x and y 
co-ordinates of the point on the initial function. The corresponding x and y 
coordinates are displayed. You can then enter another set of co-ordinates without 
entering the details of the transformation again. To leave this cycle, press the 
ON button.
