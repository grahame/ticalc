Description
-----------

This program will find:
 - Maximum height reached by the object (m)
 - Final vertical velocity of the object (ms^-1)
 - Time object is in flight (s)
 - Range of object  - distance before its hits the ground (m)

Given:

 - Initial speed of the object (ms^-1)
 - Angle of the object from the horizontal (degrees)
 - Initial height of the object from the ground (m)
 - Acceleration due to gravity (ms^-2)

Please note that this program is based upon the following assumptions:
 - There is no air resistance
 - The object is undergoing constant acceleration due to gravity
 - The horizontal velocity of the object remains constant
